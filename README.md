##2/3-way Merge in ace

The merge provides an interface for displaying and merging diffs, either two-way or three-way.
I do it based on merge addon of [codemirror](http://codemirror.net/demo/merge.html), and make it apply to ace.

Merge depends on :

> [ace](ace.c9.io)

> [google-diff-match-patch](https://code.google.com/p/google-diff-match-patch/)

> [jQuery](jquery.com)
